# Org-Specific Feature Documentation Template

After running Feature Discovery, generate an org-specific reference using this template:

```markdown
# [Org Name]: Available Features Reference

> **Org:** [Alias]
> **Cloud(s):** [Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, FSC, Health Cloud, etc.]
> **PSLs Assigned:** [Count]
> **Generated:** [Date]

## Available Features
[List features based on discovered PSLs, organized by category]

## Solution Design Checklist (Org-Specific)
[Include the 8 questions with org-specific answers pre-filled]

## Not Available
[List features NOT available based on missing PSLs]

## Recommended Skill Routing
[Based on available features, list which skills are relevant for this org]
```

This becomes a permanent reference for that org's development team.
